# DMI_from_DFT_TOTEN
Calculate DMI coefficients to arbitrary neighbor from DFT total energy for a linear chain (for now) - many systems will be equivalent however.

- nice-to-have functions:
  - automatically decide what spin spirals to use for a given problem and construct the supercells (and MAGMOM tag)
  - choose along which unit cell vector
