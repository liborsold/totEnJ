# Heisenberg exchange and DMI from DFT-calculated supercell total energies
Calculate Heisenberg exchange (in-plane and out-of-plane, uniaxial anisotropy) from total energy of magnetic supercells.  
Calculate DMI coefficients to arbitrary neighbor from DFT total energy for a linear chain (for now) - many systems will be equivalent however.

- nice-to-have functions:
  - automatically decide what spin spirals to use for a given problem and construct the supercells (and MAGMOM tag)
  - choose along which unit cell vector
